# Documentation
This is where I keep some interesting doc files, ideas and experiments that fit nowhere else.
 
Adding a backup for .vimrc. The idea is to have more or less the same configuration for Vim accross different machines.

As a sidenote on git, you can limit the number of pushes to a minimum (of git changes) all the while keeping several commits which will represent several change points, and we 'travel' between those changes.
This can help with clutter.

i.e, we can:

-> Make changes
-> git add
-> git commit 1
-> make more changes
-> git add
-> git commit 2
-> ...
-> git push

So, we get a single push tothe external repository, but all the different commits at different points in time, which we can use to our benefit

Note that after having started my internship and considering my work overload + contributing to the company's gitlab account, my presence on github will be much reduced.
I simply do not have the extra hours to document all that I want here.
Still, I have notbooks and other locations which will, sooner or later, be added here (documentation or any other adequate location)
