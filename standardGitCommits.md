Created a py_git_commit.py script to standardize my commits.
Added that scrip, renamed as 'com' to /usr/local/bin. That means that the script can now be an everywhere (on this machine).

Need to add this same script to all my machines. This will make the process of commiting changest to my github much simpler.

A reminder, to anyone reading this, that on Linux machines, you can check which folders belong to the path by typing 'echo $PATH'.

-> Might add a few more tricks to stramline the change pushing process.
