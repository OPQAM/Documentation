### Krypton 0
"Welcome to Krypton! The first level is easy. 
The following string encodes the password using Base64:

S1JZUFRPTklTR1JFQVQ="

base64 -d level0_pass

Password: KRYPTONISGREAT
### Krypton 1
"The password for level 2 is in the file ‘krypton2’. It is ‘encrypted’ using a simple rotation. 
It is also in non-standard ciphertext format. When using alpha characters for cipher text it 
is normal to group the letters into 5 letter clusters, regardless of word boundaries. 
This helps obfuscate any patterns. This file has kept the plain text word boundaries and 
carried them to the cipher text. Enjoy!"

"ROT13 is a simple substitution cipher.

Substitution ciphers are a simple replacement algorithm. In this example of a substitution cipher, 
we will explore a ‘monoalphebetic’ cipher. Monoalphebetic means, literally, “one alphabet” 
and you will see why.

This level contains an old form of cipher called a ‘Caesar Cipher’. 
A Caesar cipher shifts the alphabet by a set number. For example:

plain:  a b c d e f g h i j k ...
cipher: G H I J K L M N O P Q ...
In this example, the letter ‘a’ in plaintext is replaced by a ‘G’ in the ciphertext so, 
for example, the plaintext ‘bad’ becomes ‘HGJ’ in ciphertext.

The password for level 3 is in the file krypton3. It is in 5 letter group ciphertext. 
It is encrypted with a Caesar Cipher. Without any further information, 
this cipher text may be difficult to break. You do not have direct access to the key, 
however you do have access to a program that will encrypt anything you wish to give it 
using the key. If you think logically, this is completely easy.

One shot can solve it!

Have fun."
