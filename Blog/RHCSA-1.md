DAY 1 - 28-11-2023

Today, I'm officially embarking on a 100-day journey, aiming at the coveted Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA) certification.

To navigate this learning expedition, I'm armed with two trusty companions: Sander van Vugt's "Red Hat RHCSA 9 Cert Guide" and Mohammed A. Ghori's "RHCSA 9 Training and Exam Preparation." I'll also be enriching my knowledge base with some YT videos.

For now, I'm immersed in the fundamental principles of Linux, refreshing my memory of basic commands and concepts. I've spun up RHEL, AlmaLinux, and Fedora (because it looks nice) on virtual machines, eager to explore their depths.

So far, I've created a basic user account and ventured into the system's workings, revisiting familiar notions and reinforcing my understanding. While delving into advanced topics is paramount, revisiting the basics is essential to establish a solid foundation.

 These blog posts will be mostly ramblings and updates on my journey. Anything more meaningful will be in one of my GitHub repos.


So, yeah, this is basically my own personal journal.

Still, if you find yourself here, be very welcome!
