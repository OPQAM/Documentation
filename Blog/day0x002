Today I continued my studies in C programming and reverse engineering.

I learned about designated initializers in C arrays. These allow you to initialize specific array elements directly. For example:

Copy
int arr[] = {[0] = 1, [2] = 5, [65] = 3};
This creates an array with 66 elements (0 to 65). Most elements are initialized to 0, except for the specified ones. It's a useful feature for sparse arrays or when you need a specific array size, etc.



I also spent time practicing with printf and scanf, focusing on proper usage and potential pitfalls.

For my reverse engineering funsies, I got to fiddle with gdb and radare2. 

These two are useful tools for debugging and analyzing binaries. I practiced setting breakpoints, stepping through code, and inspecting variables in gdb. With radare2, I explored disassembling code and analyzing control flow.

In the afternoon, I set apart some time to work on a series of small exercises and projects in C.

Overall, it was a productive day. 

Weekends are good like that.
