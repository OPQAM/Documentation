Today's journey took me through Chapter 5 of van Vugt's book, where the spotlight was on terminals, consoles, SSH, SCP, SFTP, and Rsync. These play a crucial role in managing systems and facilitating a secure communication.

I got to refresh my knowledge of these essential tools and ideas, and do some practice as well.

All my troubles, in the recent past, with a Bash script making use of SSH, made going through this chapter a breeze.

Who knew? Bashing your head until you learn something makes that something stick.

Right! Next chapter will deal with user and group management. Another fun Linux subject.

I know that my writing here is kept short and mostly dry, but I do love this stuff.

 

 If you're in Portugal, enjoy the holiday!
