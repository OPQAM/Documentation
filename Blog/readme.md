I currently have little time to add to this repository, since I have to add to two other (work-related) repositorires.
(which I can't add here - NDA's etc)

Still, I thought it would be a good idea to place in here what I've been adding to my blog lately.

It's mostly related to my studies on C, low-level programming, Assembly, etc.

I'll just call these files day0x0001, day0x0002.
They will be a direct copy of my short blog additions.

Since there are blog's a plenty out there, and I'm mostly interested in keeping these ase a journal of sorts, I'll be using AI to help me write my blog in a certain atyle - film noir.
It won't be to everyone's taste, I am sure. But it will be to mine, and is an added motivation to keep this up.
