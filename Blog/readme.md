I currently have little time to add to this repository, since I have to add to two other (work-related) repositorires.
(which I can't add here - nda's etc)

Still, I thought it would be a good idea to place in here what I've been adding to my blog lately.

It's mostly related to my studies on C, low-level programming, Assembly, etc.

I'll just call these files day0x0001, day0x0002.
They will be a direct copy of my short blog additions.

When I have more free time on my hand I'll try to return to regularly posting stuff here.

PS: Yes! These blog entries will be writen with the help of AI. Why? Because I want to devote my free time to actually learning stuff, not doing blogs or surfing linkedin. ymmv
