Today I shifted my development environment. I decided to set aside Visual Studio Code and Codeium, tools I’ve been relying on for a little while. Instead, I’m moving back to Vim, which I’ve been using for quite some time and have developed a fair bit of proficiency in.

Motivation: to get more knowledgeable in the TUI (Text User Interface). I've edited the .vimrc file to create an experience that’s closer to an IDE. Since my focus is on low-level code, having an environment that’s closely tied to the terminal feels like a significant bonus.

Another strong motivation for moving away from Codeium is that it was creating some bad habits. I found myself waiting for the AI to generate boilerplate code and other basic structures for me. While convenient, this was making me complacent and less inclined to think through problems myself.

Today, I experimented with writing some simple code without any AI assistance. When I hit a snag, I was forced to think critically and solve the problem on my own, which was a refreshing change.

No regrets. Yolo, etc.

Moving forward, I’ll be exploring TUI and similar tools more deeply. Eventually, I also plan to dive into Ghidra in more depth. There’s a lot to learn. That's it.
