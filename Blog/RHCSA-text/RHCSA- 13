Today I studied user and group permissions. I delved into changing groups and setting appropriate permissions, understanding the distinctions between read, write, and execute for both files and directories, and the significance of temporary permissions.

The application of permissions: absolute and relative

Managing advanced permissions, with an exploration of SUID, SGID, and Sticky Bits with their respective values of 4, 2, and 1. 

Then I went through default permissions using umask (ACLs aren't covered in RHCSA 9, apparently). Exploring the difference between applying to all users or specific users provided.

I finally plunged into user-extended attributes (particularly 'A', 'a', 'c', 'D', 'I', 'i', 's', and 'u'). Understanding these attributes is crucial for refining control over files and directories. So, yeah. Practice, practice, practice.


Stay Black, dudes.
