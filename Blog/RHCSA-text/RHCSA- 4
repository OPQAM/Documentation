Day 4 - 01-12-2023

 

Today I reviewed the file system hierarchy, exploring the purpose of directories like /sys, /srv/run, and delved into essential file manager tools such as ls, pwd, mkdir, rmdir, cp, mv, ..., and

I also mounted and unmounted devices, discerning which devices are present + detectable and mountable.

Meanwhile, while seeking to eliminate the subshell issue that caused the SSH agent and key to be dropped I discovered that subshells are inevitable when executing scripts independently.

Therefore, the most effective approach is to retain the subshell execution and source the script from /.bashrc. This ensures that the script remains active and the SSH agent and key are retained upon completion (in other words, running it from /.bash_profile still makes the script run in a subshell).

There is still an issue with the script, or with how git is configured on my machines. You can read more about that here.

 

Poo-tee-weet.

Until next time, fellow Linux enthusiasts!
