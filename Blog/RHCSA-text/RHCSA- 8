Day 8 - 05-12-2023

Today marks the eighth day of my RHCSA 100-day challenge, and it's been a productive one, where I got some practice on the stuff I reviewed in the three previous chapters.

Embarking on Chapter 4, my focus shifted to working with text files. The tools introduced in this chapter, included less, cat, head, tail, cut, sort, wc, and grep. These play pivotal roles in manipulating and extracting information from text files.

The next phase of this journey will involve wildcards.

Keeping it short and simple today. Yesterday I had a networking exam and today I have to present a programming app.


So it goes.
Until next time, fellow Linux enthusiasts!
