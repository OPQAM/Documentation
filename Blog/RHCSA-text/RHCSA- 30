 Today is dedicated to hands-on practice, engaging with book exercises, and repeating a few steps that might be a bit harder to recall - always with the aid of man pages, of course.

I am under no rush to quickly move forward with the chapters. This isn't a race, but I do need to reach the finish line, properly. 

I've basically attempted a few of the harder exercises in the manual, and tried to sort them out just with the aid of man pages.

It's a fun exercise, and let's remember: we don't get internet access during the exam.


That's it. Happy practicing, folks!
