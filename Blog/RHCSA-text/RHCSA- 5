Today's exploration delved into the realm of file management, revisiting fundamental concepts such as wildcards, directories, absolute and relative pathnames, copying, moving, deleting, and listing files.

Practice with copying, in particular, as it is easy to overlook how that command actually works and think we are copying files to some place, while copying to another place altogether (and not getting an error report from it).

My 'workout' today must be cut short. I have a CCNA 2 exam next Monday, and really must get ready for it.


Enjoy the Weekend.

Until next time, fellow Linux enthusiasts!
