This session starts where Chapter 10 starts, and it's all about Managing Processes:with an overview of three primary process types: shell jobs, initiated from the command line; daemons, providing services usually at boot; and kernel threads.

I got to read a bit about thread management and foreground and background processes as well, revisiting pulling processes into the foreground or dispatching them to the background, along with pausing or terminating them.

Exploring parent-child relations highlighted the interconnectedness of process hierarchies. The study session wrapped up with a survey of command-line tools for practical process management.

Later, I delved into process priorities, understanding how the system allocates resources and manages execution order, and finally covered cgroups, exploring the three system areas or slices: system, user, and machine.


Have a fine week, folks.
