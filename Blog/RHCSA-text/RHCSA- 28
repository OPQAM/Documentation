Day 28 extended the exploration of Storage Management in RHEL, a continuation of yesterday's work.

Diving deeper into file systems, the study session encompassed the management of EXT4 and XFS file system properties.

Then I got to touch on the significance of swap in system performance, with a focus on creating swap partitions and swap files. Optimal usage scenarios and controlling unwanted situations was covered.

Revisiting the fundamentals of mounting and unmounting file systems included the automatic setup through /etc/fstab, configuring labels, and utilizing UUIDs. The chapter culminated with a glance at systemd mounts.

Like I said before, the next few days will be focused on Storage Management and practice.


Have a Merry Christmas!
