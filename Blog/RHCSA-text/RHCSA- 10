Day 10 - 07-12-2023

 
Today was, yet again, text processing skills day, with grep, awk and sed.
Grep, in particular, is a versatile command-line utility for searching text patterns.
 
So, given its importance, I took some time reviewing stuff I've learned before, and discovering a couple of new commands and uses.
 
I also touched on sed and awk, which are less known tools (to me).
The idea behind these exercises is to precisely get the information we desire, or to even replace it with other text strings that we'd rather have instead.
 
Thus endeth chapter 4.
Moving on to chapter 5, I'll be covering local consoles and SSH.
 
 
Carpe Diem.
