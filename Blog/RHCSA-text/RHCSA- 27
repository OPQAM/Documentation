Day 27 was a brief yet productive dive into  storage management in Linux.
I got to review the distinction between GPT and MBR, work with fdisk, gdisk and parted, and read about (the so often forgotten) mebibytes Vs megabytes.

I then covered partition utilities. Particularly, fdisk, gdisk and parted.

Some practice followed with the creation of partitions on disk.

But today is the even of Christmas, and a time for family and friends. I'll be bringing a Linux Security book with me, though, and do some reading if I can. 

 

See you tomorrow!
