Day 43 brought me back to the basics of administrator tasks - a swift refresher on users, accounts, groups, and file and folder management.

While I veered a bit from the routine practice in these subjects (which I handle daily), I enjoyed a bit of fun with simple scripting for mass file/folder creation.

Of course, the usual UIDs and GIDs were revisited, covering group and user addition and removal, among other essential tasks.

So, it was another day without much ado.

Essentials are important, man.
