RHCSA - 100 days challenge

 

15-12-2023

Today's exploration delved, yet again, into the heart of rpm and dnf. I got to learn a bit about their history and current usage. System registration took the spotlight, and I got to learn about repository choice.

I also studied some package module management,  which provided insights into optimizing the utilization of software components.

Later in the evening I'll take some time to practice some of the concepts I've learned before. This stuff is important to practice (and a pleasure to do so, if I'm being honest).

 

Behave.
