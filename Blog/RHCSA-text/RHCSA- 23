Day 23 of the RHCSA 100-day challenge saw me practicing some of the concepts I studied in the previous 11 chapters. Here's a snapshot of said chapters:

    Installation
    Essential Tools
    File Management Tools
    Text Files
    Connecting to RHEL9
    User and Group Management
    Permissions Management
    Configuring Network
    Managing Software
    Managing Processes
    Systemd

Some long and intricate commands reminded me of the importance of both man pages and consulting them adequately. Using man will be essential during the RHCSA exam.

Tomorrow promises more hands-on practice. Then we shall resume with Chapter 12 (with 'cron' and 'at').


Nothing to see here. Move along, citizen!
