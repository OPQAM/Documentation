On the twelfth day of my RHCSA 100-day challenge, I delved into user and group management and configuration.

I touched upon Policykit, and explored the use of essential commands like sudo and su. I also covered commands such as visudo, usermod, and groupmod, along with an exploration of fundamental files like /usr/bin/useradd, /usr/bin/passwd, /etc/sudoers.d, etc.

 A part of the material also touched upon configuration files, including /etc/profile, /etc/bashrc, ~/.bashrc, and ~/.profile.

I now need to solidify my study with a few exercises, to remind myself of which pitfalls and common mistakes are there waiting to get me.

The next chapter, chapter 7, will deal with  Permissions Management.

 Right. Promised myself I would never take more than 30 minutes to write these blog posts + add them to media online...

 

 Tsch√ºss!
