Day 19 of the RHCSA 100-day challenge continued the journey into the world of package management. The day began with focused practice, delving deeper into managing RPM packages.

I spent time reading, mostly exploring man files and querying RPM packages, where I listed docs, config files, and scripts - gaining insights into the intricate details of each package.

Taking a brief detour from the RHCSA curriculum, I ventured into Bacula as part of my current ATEC classes. In our security module, we're diving into backups, specifically Bacula. I practiced scheduling and selecting different backup tasks for machines, broadening my skills in data protection.

Next on the agenda is Chapter 10 - Managing Processes.

That's All Folks!
