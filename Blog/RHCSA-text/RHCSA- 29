Today was all about quality time with the family. I did very little work towards the RHCSA, other than reading a bit about LVMs and understanding how volumes work. I also tinkered a bit with Linunx, but it was all unrelated to the certification. Hey, we all got to take a break, right?

On a different note, I might start a new hobbyist project, related to IoT. But I'm keeping that hush-hush for now. 

Right. Today is a shortie, and for good reason too.

 

Enjoy your loved ones.
