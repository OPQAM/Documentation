Today I had exactly 1h30 to study anything Linux-related. I'll be out and about all day. So I took 30 minutes to organize my notes and the remaining hour I devoted to studying for next monday's exam.

That's it, really. That's this day's entry. Sorry. 

I hope to be able to add an extra entry tomorrow, related to my DigitalOcean cloud Linux server. But I'll also have to do my due diligence in prep for the exam.
