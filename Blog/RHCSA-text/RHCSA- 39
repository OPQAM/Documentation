Day 39 was a good day, a practice day, a working-man's day. I got to, once again, experiment with what I've learned so far. This intentional pause allows for deeper consolidation of learned material.

Additionally, I'm also getting my hands dirty, so to speak, with the Linux Upskill Challenge, and my recently created Linux cloud server. 

1, 2, 3, fun 2, 3.

 

If you are on a similar journey, then I wish you all the best!
