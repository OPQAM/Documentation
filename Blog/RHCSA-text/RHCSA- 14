On the fourteenth day of my RHCSA 100-day challenge, the focus was on practical application and reinforcement of the knowledge gained in previous chapters.

Today, I devoted my time to hands-on practice, consolidating the concepts learned in earlier chapters. I'm embracing the wisdom of using at least three different learning sources, and incorporating RHCSA-themed videos into my study routine. 

This multi-faceted approach provides varied perspectives on the topics at hand. 

Unfortunately, today I have to juggle between networking and Linux classes, alongside teaching math, which presents its challenges. 

Still, I'm content with the progress made, and I look forward to diving into Chapter 8 tomorrow, where the focus will be on Network Configuration.
 
Remember: escape is a commodity like anything else.
