Day 44 had me reviewing a few Find and Grep techniques along with reading quite a few man pages (relearning how to properly search them, etc).

I'm keeping this day-entry really short as there's very little to add to it.

The following days will be mostly about reviewing all of the chapters I've studied so far. Not exciting, but nevertheless fun.



Be good.
