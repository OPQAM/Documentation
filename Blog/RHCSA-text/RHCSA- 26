Today was all about configuring logging, with system logging, systemd-journald, configuring rsyslog and rotating log files.

I was mostly reviewing stuff - the main exception being rsyslog, which I have barely used, if at all.

I found out that systemd-journald stores stuff in binary in an event journal, which we then have to query. I have done that but didn't know that it was being kept in binary.

The audit service was also mentioned in the book, albeit in passing only. 

The end of the chapter is mostly about rsyslog, which I need to focus on later on, and a review of the most common logging directories: as expected, the /var/log/ family of folders. 

The next two chapters are all about Storage Management. That's where I'm headed soon.

Stay Fresh,
