Day 31 unfolded as another "pause day," a well-deserved break interwoven with family time, circus, and Linux (and some Dune) reading. The "Unix and Linux System Administration Handbook" (5th ed.) added a touch of marvel to the day, I'll be honest. It's such an easy book to read.

Amidst the leisure, I started tinkering with a recently purchased Arduino. Hopefully, one day, I'll mingle the realms of programming, IoT, and Linux - perhaps only as a hobbyist. We will see!
Tomorrow I'm back on track and move forward on the RHCSA programme.

Enjoy Life.
