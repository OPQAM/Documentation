Day 24 seamlessly extended the practical journey that began on Day 23. The day revolved around some more practice, repeating some exercises, experimenting a bit, etc. I also got to troubleshoot a few issues that came up with package management, going so far as having to install a new virtual machine just to compare states and logs.

So, yeah! Not an exciting day to write about, but there it is. Tomorrow I'll be jumping head on into the next chapter.

 

Be good to one another.
