Day 9 - 06-12-2023

Today marks the ninth day of this (let's say) 100-day challenge, and it's been a day of both reflection and exploration.

I dedicated a considerable amount of time to practice, delving into a Linux test I recently took in class, acknowledging a couple of small errors and ensuring that I'm not repeating them.

I also studied some of the past concepts I touched upon days 1 to 8.

Finally, I revisited wildcards and extended wildcards, with a particular focus on their application with grep. These are powerful searching and pattern-matching tools that really let us step up our command-line game.


So long, and thanks for all the fish.
