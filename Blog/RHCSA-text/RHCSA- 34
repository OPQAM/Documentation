On day 34 I finished Chapter 15, advancing into the realm of LVM. Namely, I covered resizing of LVM logical volumes, adjusting file systems and resizing volume groups to accommodate storage needs.

I finished the chapter with Stratis - a storage solution that has been RHELs default since RHEL 8. I learned how to creating an managing Stratis storage.

Tomorrow, a new year and a new Part and Chapter. It's the Kernel, baby.

And we'll start with Basic Kernel Management.

 

Happy New Year!
