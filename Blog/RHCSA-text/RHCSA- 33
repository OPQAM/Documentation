Day 33 saw a purposeful detour into the realms of Apache2 and associated technologies... a deviation from my current linear progression of the RHCSA. This deliberate choice stems from the anticipation of an upcoming Linux exam on the 8th of January, which encompasses these subjects.

While 99% certain that Apache is part of the RHCSA coverage, the decision to proactively study these topics aligns with my, well... Linux exam on the 8th of January.

It's all Linux,right? And since I seriously need to get a good grip on the subject in a tenday, I might as well do this little detour.
So, Apache and friends it is!

 

Stay slick.
