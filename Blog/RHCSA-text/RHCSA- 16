On the sixteenth day of my RHCSA 100-day challenge it was all about practice, practice, practice.

Yup, all hands-on, focusing mostly on issues related to users and management, but also with a bit of this and a little more of that.

And that's it! Unfortunately I have a very full day, and can't get into examples or specifics. Hopefully I'll have some time to practice some more in the evening. 

 

Remember: success is not final, failure is not fatal
