Day 3 - 30-11-2023

Today's endeavours into the realm of RHCSA brought me to the end of Chapter 2 of Sander van Vugt's book. I finished  with help pages, specifically info, pinfo, and man pages, proving to be an invaluable resource for navigating the vast command-line landscape.

I took some time jotting down notes for later QoL command searching and usage. 

I also did a refresher on fundamental concepts STDOUT and STDERR redirecting concepts, and the practical distinction between subshells and shells.

In the evening, I'll be revisiting my autoPull.sh script, and try to find more elegant and effective solution to that mess. 

 

That's all she wrote.

Until next time, fellow Linux enthusiasts!
