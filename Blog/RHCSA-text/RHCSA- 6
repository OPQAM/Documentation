Day 6 - 03-12-2023

Today I reviewed and practiced with hard links and symbolic links, something I rather like, for some reason or another.

They have many uses and, as an example, I keep my most important configuration files inside a dotfiles folder which is, in turn, kept under version control with Git. This ensures that any changes made to one configuration or (otherwise important) file is kept and referenced for later. So, data integrity is kept.

If any issues arise, I only have to revert back to a moment where the config files we working just fine.

I've seen other dotfiles 'solutions' online. They are both more intricate and more advanced, but mine works and I can pop it up and make it run instantly, which is great. I like simple things that work.

Symbolic links, on the other hand, excel in situations where flexibility and organization are key. They allow for seamless navigation and access to files or directories located elsewhere in(!) the filesystem, without the need for physical data duplication.


Again, time is short. And OSPF won't study iself (actually...it actually does)...
Until next time, fellow Linux enthusiasts!
