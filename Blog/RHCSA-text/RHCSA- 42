Let's get back on track, friends. It's day 42, and for those familiar with that number, we all know it holds a deep and meaningful answer. Too bad we're not so sure about the question. 

Onwards!

After a brief hiatus, attributed to family illness, I'm finally back on the RHCSA learning journey.

In the coming days, my focus will mirror today's routine: a review of previous chapters, followed by doing as many exercises as I can. The RHCSA is a hands on exam, so I might as well get hands... on.

So Long, and Thanks for all the Fish!
