Day 37 unfolded as a dedicated review and practice day, in which I got to focus on hands-on implementation and practical application of the concepts explored during this RHCSA journey.

In addition to revisiting former RHCSA topics, I got to practice other core Linux Admin items, such as Apache, htaccess, and SSL certificates. 

Note to self: You have an exam focusing on these subjects, on the 8th of this very month, so... yeah.

Tomorrow will resume our work and we'll find out more about the Linux Kernel.


Have a wonderful day, folks!
