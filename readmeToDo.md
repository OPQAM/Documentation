My deb-of-night machine is always loading my autoPull script correctly, but always warning that there isn't a certain key at a certain location. This isn't related to the autoPull script. It must have to do with previously loaded agents, or something else git related. I need to check the configurations.

Also, on some of my machines, from time to time, one of my repos gets copied into the user's root folder (even root). What causes this?
I want to replicate it, and right now, my guts are telling me that this is the result of badly used pushing/pulling  requests and other updates done by hand. Need to check it when I find the time to do so.
