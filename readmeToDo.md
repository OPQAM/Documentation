I need to get a better grasp of Git - it's still acting wonky, and I have to commit a bit more effort to it,
going from a tool I barely understand and basically know bit by bit whenever I need it to something I 
actually know a bit about.

Spend time to save time, and all that jazz.

Otherwise I will, indeed, spend a lot of time troubleshooting non issues.

How exactly do SSH keys (really) work?
Understand the Agent, how it is loaded, how it can be configured and managed, what are its uses.

- I have to load the agent, ok. But even after loading the agent and pointing ssh-add to the correct key, I'm being told that it's not able to load some other key (it still works) - what configuration process is asking to load that key? Is there a key associated with this (root) user?
